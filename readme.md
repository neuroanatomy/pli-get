# Acquiring PLI data

 With a basler camera and spli6.

--> PAY ATTENTION TO THE NUMBER OF TEETH IN THE MACHINE'S POLARISER GEAR

The old small pli ball-bearing gears had 92 teeth, which is the default in the code. The new laser cut gears have 96 teeth.

The sheep data from 3 of July was acquired with the 96 teeth gear but the code had 92 teeth configure, which means the angle is slightly off.

The large pli has 112 teeth.
